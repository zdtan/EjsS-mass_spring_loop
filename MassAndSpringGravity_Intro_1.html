      Planar Motion of a Mass Connected to a Spring in Gravity
    </h2>
    <p>
      This is the simulation of the motion of a mass <i>m</i> situated at the 
      end of a spring of length <i>L<sub>0</sub></i> and negligible mass. The 
      spring is fixed at the other end and the motion is restricted to two 
      spatial dimensions, with the y-axis representing the vertical (if 
      gravity is switched on).
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      We use Hooke's law for the spring force, and include a damping term that 
      is proportional to the difference of the velocities of the masses on 
      both ends of the spring.
    </p>
    <p>
      
    </p>
    <p>
      Applying Newton's Second Law yields a second-order ordinary differential 
      equation, which we solve numerically in the simulation and visualise the 
      results.
